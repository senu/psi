CPPUnit test runner.

1. It runs almost all unittests (see below).
2. MessageValidator and DefaultHTMLTextFormatter unittests are merged with qa/unittest.
3. HTMLChatView unittest cannot be merged with qa/unittest, you have to compile src/unittest/htmlchatview/.
4. Webkit JavaScript CSSValidator unittests are in src/unittest/htmlchatview/cssValidatorTest.html - run them e.g. with Qt Demo Browser.
